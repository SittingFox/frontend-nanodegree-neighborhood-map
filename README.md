Neighborhood Tour
=================

With this, you can take a tour around the neighborhood I chose.


How to Use?
-----------

Open index.html in your browser. You will be greeted with a Google map showing the location I have picked, with particular places marked out on it. These will also be listed alongside the map, and this list is filterable by the available search bar.
